  <h2>About Myself</h2>
	 <p>I am a young loving mom, with a Marine Corps background that understands the importance of nutrition. When I first knew I was going to be a mother,  I was determined to live an even healthier lifestyle for myself and soon to be baby. Ever since then I planned to provide the very best for my son's mealtime, especially now as he explores all the types of foods that are offered to him. I believe when a child tries eating their first foods, it creates a new important experience. It is important to take food serious for your little one to enjoy becuse it is the foundation  that helps nourish their bodies for their development.</p>
