  <h2>Nurturing Our Little One's Health</h2>
  
  <p class="body_index">Geared For Littles is an introductory website that will help guide you on your journey to provide the very best for your little one's health. It's no question that food is the key to growth and development. So why not provide the very best for your youngster. Sure you can go ahead and buy pre-made baby food but when you buy store bought baby food, you are also buying the additives and unnecessary ingredients that come inside the pre-made baby food. The best and most effective way to help your little one growth and development is to make the food yourself. It's most rewarding to see your child enjoy the same food you eat as well as knowing it will only benefit them for their future. <br>
