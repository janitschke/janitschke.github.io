		 <p class="body_education">I wanted to provide  a few simple homemade baby food purees ideas, that will allow for a great start on your journey with your little one. These recipes  just so happen to contain a few foods that are only blended up together. It's just that easy! The list of foods shown will help give you an idea of which foods go well together while providing a variety of nutrients and flavors for each meal your little one enjoys. Your homemade  baby food puree comes from real foods making it natural. Not only allowing for a better alternative to store bought baby food but allow for an easier transition to eating other natural foods. I hope that some of these baby food purees  draw  inspiration to you, so you can be able to create your own.</p>
