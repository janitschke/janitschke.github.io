		 <p class="body_education">Introducing food to your little one is their first step to starting meal time with the family. Mealtime should be an enjoyable activity that requires time. Most people prefer to buy store bought pre-made baby food because they consider it to be a time saver. While it may be considered a time saver, many baby food products are being recalled. To make sure your providing the best healthy foods for your child's growth and development, making natural baby food yourself  can ensure the nutrients they will receive as they continue to grow. The safest and most effective way to feed your child is to prepare it yourself.  I have provided a simple list to help let you know what basics are best for your child and which ones should be avoided till they are older. </p>
